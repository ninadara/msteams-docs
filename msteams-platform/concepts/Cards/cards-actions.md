# Card actions

Cards used by bots and messaging extensions in Teams support the following activity ([`CardAction`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-add-rich-card-attachments#process-events-within-rich-cards)) types. Note that these actions differ from `potentialActions` for Office 365 Connector cards when used from Connectors.

| Type | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `openUrl` | Opens a URL in the built-in browser. |
| `messageBack` | Sends a message and payload to the bot (from the user who clicked the button or tapped the card) and sends a separate message to the chat stream. |
| `imBack`| Sends a message to the bot (from the user who clicked the button or tapped the card). This message (from user to bot) is visible to all conversation participants. |
| `invoke` | Sends a message and payload to the bot (from the user who clicked the button or tapped the card). This message is not visible. |
| `signin` | Initiates OAuth flow, allowing bots to connect with secure services. |

> [!NOTE]
>* Teams does not support `CardAction` types not listed in the preceding table.
>* Teams does not support the `potentialActions` property.

Teams also supports [Adaptive card actions](~/concepts/cards/cards-actions#adaptive-card-actions), which are only used by Adaptive cards. These actions are listed in their own section at the end of this reference.

## openUrl

This action type specifies a URL to launch in the default browser. Note that your bot does not receive any notice on which button was clicked.

The `value` field must contain a full and properly formed URL.

```json
{
    "type": "openUrl",
    "title": "Tabs in Teams",
    "value": "https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/tabs"
}
```

## messageBack

>**New**

With `messageBack`, you can create a fully customized action with the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `title` | Appears as the button label. |
| `displayText` | Optional. Echoed by the user into the chat stream when the action is performed. This text is *not* sent to your bot. |
| `value` | Sent to your bot when the action is performed. You can encode context for the action, such as unique identifiers or a JSON object. |
| `text` | Sent to your bot when the action is performed. Use this property to simplify bot development: Your code can check a single top-level property to dispatch bot logic. |

The flexibility of `messageBack` means that your code can choose not to leave a visible user message in the history simply by not using `displayText`.

```json
{
  â‹®
  "buttons": [
    {
    "type": "messageBack",
    "title": "My MessageBack button",
    "displayText": "I clicked this button",
    "text": "User just clicked the MessageBack button",
    "value": "{\"property\": \"propertyValue\" }"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `value` property can be either a serialized JSON string or a JSON object.

### Inbound message example

`replyToId` contains the ID of the message that the card action came from. Use it if you want to update the message.

```json
{
   "text":"User just clicked the MessageBack button",
   "value":{
      "property":"propertyValue"
   },
   "type":"message",
   "timestamp":"2017-06-22T22:38:47.407Z",
   "id":"f:5261769396935243054",
   "channelId":"msteams",
   "serviceUrl":"https://smba.trafficmanager.net/amer-client-ss.msg/",
   "from":{
      "id":"29:102jd210jd010icsoaeclaejcoa9ue09u",
      "name":"John Smith"
   },
   "conversation":{
      "id":"19:malejcou081i20ojmlcau0@thread.skype;messageid=1498171086622"
   },
   "recipient":{
      "id":"28:76096e45-119f-4736-859c-6dfff54395f7",
      "name":"MyBot"
   },
   "entities":[
      {
         "locale":"en-US",
         "country":"US",
         "platform":"Windows",
         "type":"clientInfo"
      }
   ],
   "channelData":{
      "channel":{
         "id":"19:malejcou081i20ojmlcau0@thread.skype"
      },
      "team":{
         "id":"19:12d021jdoijsaeoaue0u@thread.skype"
      },
      "tenant":{
         "id":"bec8e231-67ad-484e-87f4-3e5438390a77"
      }
   },
    "replyToId": "1:19uJ8TZA1cZcms7-2HLOW3pWRF4nSWEoVnRqc0DPa_kY"
}
```

## imBack

This action triggers a return message to your bot, as if the user typed it in a normal chat message. Your user, and all other users if in a channel, will see that button response.

The `value` field should contain the text string echoed in the chat and therefore sent back to the bot. This is the message text you will process in your bot to perform the desired logic. Note: this field is a simple string - there is no support for formatting or hidden characters.

```json
{
    "type": "imBack",
    "title": "More",
    "value": "Show me more"
}
```

## invoke

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that you use `messageBack` instead of `invoke`. While `invoke` can be used directly, it is designed to be used indirectly. For example, `invoke` is used to send character-by-character keystrokes for [compose extensions](~/concepts/messaging-extensions.md).

The `invoke` message type silently sends a JSON payload that you define to your bot.  This is useful if you want to send more detailed information back to your bot without having to send via a simple `imBack` text string.  Note that the user, in personal or channel chat, sees no notification as a result of their click.

The `value` field will contain a stringified JSON object. You can include identifiers or any other context necessary to carry out the operation.

```json
{
    "type": "invoke",
    "title": "Option 1",
    "value": {
        "option": "opt1"
    } 
}
```

When a user clicks the button, your bot will receive the predefined `value` object with some additional info. Please note that the activity type will be `invoke` instead of `message` (activity.Type == "invoke").

### Example: Invoke button definition (.NET)

```csharp
var button = new CardAction()
{
    Title = "Option 1",
    Type = "invoke",
    Value = "{\"option\": \"opt1\"}"
};
```

### Example: Incoming invoke message

`replyToId` contains the ID of the message that the card action came from. Use it if you want to update the message.

```json
{
    "type": "invoke",
    "value": {
        "option": "opt1"
    },
    "timestamp": "2017-02-10T04:11:19.614Z",
    "localTimestamp": "2017-02-09T21:11:19.614-07:00",
    "id": "f:6894910862892785420",
    "channelId": "msteams",
    "serviceUrl": "https://smba.trafficmanager.net/amer-client-ss.msg/",

    },
    "recipient": {

        "name": "MyBot"
    },
    "entities": [
        {
            "locale": "en-US",
            "country": "US",
            "platform": "Web",
            "type": "clientInfo"
        }
    ],
    "channelData": {
        "channel": {
            "id": "19:dc5ba12695be4eb7bf457cad6b4709eb@thread.skype"
        },
        "team": {
            "id": "19:712c61d0ef384e5fa681ba90ca943398@thread.skype"
        },
        "tenant": {
            "id": "72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47"
        }
    },
    "replyToId": "1:19uJ8TZA1cZcms7-2HLOW3pWRF4nSWEoVnRqc0DPa_kY"
}
```

## signin

Initiates OAuth flow, allowing bots to connect with secure services, as described in more detail here: [Authentication flow in bots](~/concepts/authentication/auth-flow-bot).

## Adaptive card actions (supported in Developer Preview only)

Adaptive cards support three action types:

* [Action.OpenUrl](http://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.OpenUrl.html)
* [Action.Submit](http://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.Submit.html)
* [Action.ShowCard](http://adaptivecards.io/explorer/Action.ShowCard.html)

These actions are only supported by Adaptive cards. Adaptive cards do not support the other actions listed above this section.
