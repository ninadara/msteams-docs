# Authenticate a user in a Microsoft Teams bot

There are many services that you may wish to consume inside your Teams app, and most of those services require authentication and authorization to get access to the service. Services include Facebook, Twitter, and of course Teams. Users of Teams have user profile information stored in Azure Active Directory (AAD) using Microsoft Graph. This article will focus on authentication using AAD to get access to this information.

OAuth is an open standard for authentication used by AAD and many other service providers. Understanding OAuth is a prerequisite for working with authentication in Teams and AAD. The examples below use the OAuth2 Implicit Grant flow with the goal of eventually reading the user's profile information from AAD and Graph.

The authentication flow described in this article is very similar to that of tabs except that tabs can use web based authentication flow, and bots require authentication to be driven from code. The concepts in this article will also be useful when implementing authentication from the mobile platform.

For a general overview of authentication flow for bots see the topic [Authentication flow in bots](~/concepts/authentication/auth-flow-bot).

## Configuring identity providers

See the topic [Configure identity providers](~/concepts/authentication/auth-configure) for detailed steps on configuring OAuth 2.0 callback redirect URL(s) when using Azure Active Directory as an identity provider.

## Initiate authentication flow

Authentication flow should be triggered by a user action. You should not open the authentication pop-up automatically because this is likely to trigger the browser's pop-up blocker as well as confuse the user.

## Add UI to start authentication

Add UI to the bot to enable the user to sign in when needed. Here it is done from a Thumbnail card, in TypeScript:

```typescript
// Show prompt of options
protected async promptForAction(session: builder.Session): Promise<void> {
    let msg = new builder.Message(session)
        .addAttachment(new builder.ThumbnailCard(session)
            .title(this.providerDisplayName)
            .buttons([
                 builder.CardAction.messageBack(session, "{}", "Sign in")
                     .text("SignIn")
                     .displayText("Sign in"),
                  builder.CardAction.messageBack(session, "{}", "Show profile")
                     .text("ShowProfile")
                     .displayText("Show profile"),
                  builder.CardAction.messageBack(session, "{}", "Sign out")
                     .text("SignOut")
                     .displayText("Sign out"),
            ]));
    session.send(msg);
}
```

Three buttons have been added to the Hero Card: Sign in, Show Profile, and Sign out.

## Sign the user in

Because of the validation that must be performed for security reasons and the support for the mobile versions of Teams, the code isn't shown here, but [here's an example of the code that kicks off the process when the user presses the Sign in button.](https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-sample-auth-node/blob/e84020562d7c8b83f4a357a4a4d91298c5d2989d/src/dialogs/BaseIdentityDialog.ts#L154-L195).

The validation and mobile support are explained in the topic [Authentication flow in bots](~/concepts/authentication/auth-flow-bot).

Be sure to add the domain of your authentication redirect URL to the [`validDomains`](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema#validdomains) section of the manifest. If you don't, the login popup will not appear.

## Showing user profile information

Although getting an access token is difficult because of all the transitions back and forth across different websites and the security issues that must be addressed, once you have a token, obtaining information from Azure Active Directory is straightforward. The bot makes a call to the `me` Graph endpoint with the access token. Graph responds with the user information for the person who logged in. Information from the response is used to construct a bot card and sent.

```typescript
// Show user profile
protected async showUserProfile(session: builder.Session): Promise<void> {
    let azureADApi = this.authProvider as AzureADv1Provider;
    let userToken = this.getUserToken(session);

    if (userToken) {
        let profile = await azureADApi.getProfileAsync(userToken.accessToken);
        let profileCard = new builder.ThumbnailCard()
            .title(profile.displayName)
            .subtitle(profile.mail)
            .text(`${profile.jobTitle}<br/> ${profile.officeLocation}`);
        session.send(new builder.Message().addAttachment(profileCard));
    } else {
        session.send("Please sign in to AzureAD so I can access your profile.");
    }

    await this.promptForAction(session);
}

// Helper function to make the Graph API call
public async getProfileAsync(accessToken: string): Promise<any> {
    let options = {
        url: "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
        json: true,
        headers: {
            "Authorization": `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        },
    };
    return await request.get(options);
}
```

If the user is not signed in they are prompted to do so.

## Sign the user out

```typescript
// Handle user logout request
private async handleLogout(session: builder.Session): Promise<void> {
    if (!utils.getUserToken(session, this.providerName)) {
        session.send(`You're already signed out of ${this.providerDisplayName}.`);
    } else {
        utils.setUserToken(session, this.providerName, null);
        session.send(`You're now signed out of ${this.providerDisplayName}.`);
    }

    await this.promptForAction(session);
}
```
