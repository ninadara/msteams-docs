# Add bots to Microsoft Teams apps

Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with Microsoft Teams users naturally through chat. Or provide a simple commands-based bot, to be used as your "command-line" interface for your broader Teams app experience. You can make a notification-only bot, which can push information relevant to your users directly to them in a channel or direct message. You can even bring your existing Bot Framework&ndash;based bot and add Teams-specific support to make your experience shine.

> [!TIP]
> If you are just looking for a way to simply extend your team by integrating with custom tools and services in a secure manner, check out our [outgoing webhook](~/concepts/outgoingwebhook) feature. Be aware, though, that outgoing webhooks simply leverage your existing web services - they can't access non-messaging APIs, perform asynchronous posting, or add button actions to cards.

## What you need to know: Bots

A bot appears just like any other team member you interact with in a conversation except that it has a hexagonal avatar icon and is always online.

A bot behaves slightly depending on what kind of conversation it is involved in. Teams support several kinds of conversations (called scopes in the [Manifest](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema)).

* `teams` Also called channel conversations
* `personal` Conversations between a bot and a single user

See [Have a conversation with a Microsoft Teams bot](~/concepts/bots/conversations/bots-conversations) for more information.

With Microsoft Teams apps, you can make the bot the star of your experience, or just a helper. Bots are distributed as part of your broader app package which can include other capabilities such as tabs or messaging extensions. If your bot is the star, be sure to take advantage of the [tabs](~/concepts/tabs/tabs-overview) capability. Use this rich web view to surface accompanying experiences and information that helps your users best interact with your service.

## Bot APIs

Microsoft Teams supports most of the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/). (If you already have a bot that's based on the Bot Framework, you can easily adapt it to work in Microsoft Teams.) We recommend you use either C# or TypeScript to take advantage of our SDKs. These packages extend the basic Bot Builder classes and methods:

* Using specialized card types like the Office 365 Connector card
* Consuming and setting Teams-specific channel data on activities
* Processing messaging extension requests

The SDK extensions install dependencies, including the Bot Builder SDK.

* **.NET**&emsp;To use the Microsoft Teams extensions for the Bot Builder SDK for .NET, install the [Microsoft.Bot.Connector.Teams](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Connector.Teams) NuGet package in your Visual Studio project.
* **Node.js**&emsp;To use the Microsoft Teams extensions for the Bot Builder SDK for Node.js, add the [botbuilder-teams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botbuilder-teams) npm package.
* **Source code**&emsp;You can find the full source code for the extensions in the [BotBuilder-MicrosoftTeams](https://github.com/OfficeDev/BotBuilder-MicrosoftTeams) repo on Github.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can develop Teams apps in any other web-programming technology and call the [Bot Framework REST APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/rest-api/bot-framework-rest-overview) directly, but you must perform all token handling yourself.

*Teams App Studio* is a new tool that can help configure your manifest and your app. It also contains a React control library and an interactive card builder. See [Getting started with Teams App Studio](~/get-started/get-started-app-studio).

## Outgoing webhooks

Outgoing webhooks allow you to create a simple bot for basic interaction, like kicking off a workflow or other simple commands you may need. Outgoing webhooks live only in the team in which you create them and are intended for simple processes specific to your company's workflow. See [outgoing webhooks](~/concepts/outgoingwebhook) for more information.

## Build a great Teams bot

The following topics will guide you through the process of creating a great bot for Teams.

* [Get started with apps for Teams](~/get-started/get-started-nodejs) Create a "hello world" app.
* [Design a great bot](~/get-started/design#designing-a-great-bot): Microsoft Teams is the place for group and team collaboration. Consider what functionality your bot can bring to this collaboration environment, via personal conversations or as part of a channel conversation. A great bot on Teams will also find ways to leverage the unique tabs feature, via a [configurable tab](~/concepts/tabs/tabs-overview) or a [static tab](~/concepts/tabs/tabs-static).
* [Create a bot](~/concepts/bots/bots-create): Take advantage of the great tools, documentation, and community provided by the Bot Framework team.
* [Talk to your bot](~/concepts/bots/bot-conversations/bots-conversations): Add basic conversation flow and leverage channel-specific functionality. If you develop in .NET or Node.js, use our [extensions for the Bot Builder SDK](~/get-started/code#microsoft-teams-extensions-for-the-bot-builder-sdk) to simplify your work.
* [Using cards in your bot](~/concepts/bots/bot-conversations/bots-cards) Design cards to communicate and accept user response.
* [Respond to bot events](~/concepts/bots/bots-notifications).
* [Notification-only bots](~/concepts/bots/bots-notification-only) Using bots to send notifications for your app.
* [Get context](~/concepts/bots/bots-context) Get information about the user.
* [Bot menus](~/concepts/bots/bots-menus) Using menus in bots.
* [Using tabs with bots](~/concepts/bots/bots-with-tabs) Making tabs and bots work together.
* [Test your bot](~/concepts/bots/bots-test): Add your bot for personal or team conversations to see it in action.
* [Publish your bot](~/publishing/apps-publish): Create your Teams package, add other capabilities, and submit it to AppSource.
