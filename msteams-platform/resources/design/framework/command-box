# Optimize your app for the command box

Wherever you go in Teams, the command box is there at the top of the screen. Users can quickly send commands to any of their installed apps right from the box, enabling them to query and pull content from your app without stepping away from what they're doing.

## Guidelines

**The @ command**: Typing **@** in the command box will display a list of the user's installed apps. Once someone has installed your app, they'll be able to summon it simply by entering this command and then selecting it from the list or typing its name.

**Active app state**: After a user has employed the **@** command and then selected your app, they'll see the app's name and logo on the left side of the box, followed by a line of helper text that should tell the user what they can do (for example, "Enter a search term"). This is the active app state.

**The command box drop-down**: Suggestions or results based on the user's query will appear in the drop-down field below the command box.

* **Suggestions** are based on recent activity or viewed content.

* **Results** can be presented as a list, a grid, or a card.

## Best practices

**Commands**: Prioritize them. Your app's most important functionalities should be the easiest things to do.

**Keep it simple**: Use one-word terms for your commands. A command's nomenclature should make its purpose clear, and should be consistent with terms used in the app itself. Use common language that newcomers to your app will understand.

**Failure is not an option**: Enact a no-fail policy. Make sure your users always have a path to success (whether that path leads to an app, a tab, or a dialog), even if they don't complete a command.
