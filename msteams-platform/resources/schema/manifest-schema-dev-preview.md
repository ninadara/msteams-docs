# Developer Preview Reference: version 1.3 manifest schema for Microsoft Teams

>Notes:
>See [Developer Preview](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro) for information on the program and how you can join.
>If you are not using the developer preview you should not be using this version of the manifest. See [Reference: Manifest schema for Microsoft Teams](~/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for the public version of the manifest.

The Microsoft Teams manifest describes how the app integrates into the Microsoft Teams product. Your manifest must conform to the schema hosted at [`https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/sdk/v1.3.0-beta.2/manifest/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json`](https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/sdk/v1.3.0-beta.2/manifest/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json).

## What's new in the Developer Preview

This is a preview of the 1.3 version of the Teams app manifest. It includes:

* Apps in group chat changes:
  * A new scope called "groupchat" has been added to the bots and configurable tabs sections of the manifest. For more information on the feature see: [Features in the Public Developer Preview for Microsoft Teams](~/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-features).

```

The schema defines the following properties:

## $schema

*Optional, but recommended* &ndash; String

The URL referencing the JSON Schema for the manifest.

> [!TIP]
> Specify the schema at the beginning of your manifest to enable IntelliSense or similar support from your code editor: `"$schema": "https://statics.teams.microsoft.com/sdk/v1.3/manifest/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",`

## manifestVersion

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the manifest schema this manifest is using. It should be "1.3".

## version

**Required** &ndash; String

The version of the specific app. If you update something in your manifest, the version must be incremented as well. This way, when the new manifest is installed, it will overwrite the existing one and the user will get the new functionality. If this app was submitted to the store, the new manifest will have to be re-submitted and re-validated. Then, users of this app will get the new updated manifest automatically in a few hours, after it is approved.

If the app requested permissions change, users will be prompted to upgrade and re-consent to the app. 

This version string must follow the [semver](http://semver.org/) standard (MAJOR.MINOR.PATH).

## id

**Required** &ndash; Microsoft app ID

The unique Microsoft-generated identifier for this app. If you have registered a bot via the Microsoft Bot Framework, or your tab's web app already signs in with Microsoft, you should already have an ID and should enter it here. Otherwise, you should generate a new ID at the Microsoft Application Registration Portal ([My Applications](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)), enter it here, and then reuse it when you [add a bot](~/concepts/bots/bots-create).

## packageName

**Required** &ndash; String

A unique identifier for this app in reverse domain notation; for example, com.example.myapp.

## developer
